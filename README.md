This is the code repository for [Data Structures and Algorithms with the C++ STL](https://www.packtpub.com/product/data-structures-and-algorithms-with-the-c-stl/9781835468555?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781835468555), published by Packt.

**A guide for modern C++ practitioners**

## What is this book about?
While the Standard Template Library (STL) offers a rich set of tools for data structures and algorithms, navigating its intricacies can be daunting for intermediate C++ developers without expert guidance. This book offers a thorough exploration of the STLâ€™s components, covering fundamental data structures, advanced algorithms, and concurrency features.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Streamline data handling using the std::vector
* Master advanced usage of STL iterators
* Optimize memory in STL containers
* Implement custom STL allocators
* Apply sorting and searching with STL algorithms
* Craft STL-compatible custom types
* Manage concurrency and ensure thread safety in STL
* Harness the power of parallel algorithms in STL

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. 

The code will look like the following:
```
template <typename T,
 typename AllocatorPolicy = std::allocator<T>>
class CustomVector {
 // Implementation using AllocatorPolicy for memory
 // allocation
};
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for intermediate-level C++ developers looking to enhance their software development skills. Familiarity with basic C++ syntax and object-oriented programming (OOP) as well as some exposure to data structures and algorithms is assumed.
Tailored to software engineers, computer science students, and hobbyist programmers, this book delves into C++ STL for practical application, performance enhancement, and efficient coding practices.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-22).
